# Lumpia Maker

I created Lumpia Maker because I wanted to make an app that included food. I initially wanted to do a boba app, but I figured I should make something that shows part of my life and background, so I decided that this app would be Filipino centered.

You can pick the protein for your lumpia, and pair it with any Filipino desserts you like. If you don't know any Filipino desserts, look some up and add the ones you want to try!
